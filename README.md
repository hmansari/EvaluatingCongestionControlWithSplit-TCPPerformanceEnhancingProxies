# EvaluatingCongestionControlWithSplit-TCPPerformanceEnhancingProxies
Source code

Modeled the performance of Split TCP PEPs in conjunction with modern topologies and algorithms using the NS2 simulator. 
Presented results and provide recommendations on when to best use split connection PEPs as well as which TCP variant is most 
suited for each topology.
